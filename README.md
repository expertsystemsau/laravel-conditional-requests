Conditional requests are the part of HTTP that lets a client and a server agree on *which version* of a resource they are talking about, before either of them acts on it. [RFC 9110 §13](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#section-13) defines them; ETag and `Last-Modified` are just the two validators underneath.

They solve two different problems with the same handshake:

- **Reads** — the client already holds version `v7`. If nothing has changed, it should get an empty `304 Not Modified` instead of the payload again. Less bandwidth, less serialization, faster clients.
- **Writes** — the client read version `v7`, edited it, and is now sending it back. If someone else saved `v8` in between, the write must be **refused**, not silently applied over the top. This is the lost update problem, and `If-Match` is the fix.

Most Laravel packages in this space only do the first half, and only via ETag. This one treats conditional requests as the feature and validators as an implementation detail.

## Status

> [!WARNING]
> **Pre-release — under active development.** The read path described below ships and is tested. The write path (`conditional:required`, `412`, `428`), the `Last-Modified` family, model-derived validators, and locking are not implemented yet — they are marked on the [roadmap](#roadmap) below. Nothing is stable until `v1.0.0`.

## Requirements

- PHP 8.3, 8.4, or 8.5
- Laravel 12.x or 13.x

## Installation

Install the package via Composer:

```bash
composer require expertsystemsau/laravel-conditional-requests
```

The service provider is auto-discovered. No further setup is required to get started.

### Publishing Resources

You may publish all of the package's resources at once:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="laravel-conditional-requests"
```

Or publish each resource individually:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="laravel-conditional-requests-config"
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="laravel-conditional-requests-lang"
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="laravel-conditional-requests-assets"
```

## Usage

### Conditional reads

Apply the middleware to any route that returns a cacheable representation. The response gets a validator attached, and matching subsequent requests short-circuit to `304 Not Modified` with an empty body.

```php
Route::get('/articles/{article}', ShowArticle::class)
    ->middleware('conditional');
```

```http
GET /articles/42
→ 200 OK
  ETag: "d41d8cd98f00b204"

GET /articles/42
If-None-Match: "d41d8cd98f00b204"
→ 304 Not Modified          # no body, no serialization
```

> [!NOTE]
> If a response already carries an `ETag` — set by your own application code — the middleware leaves it completely alone: your tag is preserved, and that response never takes part in `304` handling.

> [!NOTE]
> A `HEAD` request is handed to your controller as a `GET` while the validator is computed, so it gets the same `ETag` and can still trigger a `304`; the body is emptied again before the response goes out. In practice this is invisible, since Laravel already routes `HEAD` to the `GET` action — but controller code that inspects `$request->method()` or `isMethod('HEAD')` will see `GET` for the duration of that call.

> [!NOTE]
> Everything below this line is the design contract for a later release and is **not implemented yet**.

### Conditional writes (lost update protection)

Require the client to state which version it believes it is modifying. A stale token is rejected with `412`; a missing one with `428`.

```php
Route::patch('/articles/{article}', UpdateArticle::class)
    ->middleware('conditional:required');
```

```http
PATCH /articles/42
If-Match: "d41d8cd98f00b204"
→ 200 OK                    # still current, write applied

PATCH /articles/42
If-Match: "d41d8cd98f00b204"
→ 412 Precondition Failed   # someone else got there first

PATCH /articles/42
                            # no If-Match header at all
→ 428 Precondition Required
```

`428` is the piece most implementations skip. Without it a client can simply omit the header and go straight back to clobbering other people's writes — the protection is opt-out by default. `conditional:required` makes it opt-in-by-force for the routes you choose.

### Header reference

| Request header | Applies to | On match | On mismatch |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `If-None-Match` | reads | `304 Not Modified` | `200 OK` with body |
| `If-Modified-Since` | reads | `304 Not Modified` | `200 OK` with body |
| `If-Match` | writes | write proceeds | `412 Precondition Failed` |
| `If-Unmodified-Since` | writes | write proceeds | `412 Precondition Failed` |
| *(absent)* | writes, when required | — | `428 Precondition Required` |

## Roadmap

- [x] `conditional` middleware — response validators and `304` short-circuiting
- [x] Configurable exclusions — methods, status codes, routes, and response sizes
- [ ] `conditional:required` middleware — `If-Match` enforcement with `412` / `428`
- [x] Strong and weak ETag generation, with a configurable strategy
- [ ] `Last-Modified` / `If-Modified-Since` support alongside ETags
- [ ] Model-derived validators, so an ETag comes from the record's version rather than a hash of the rendered body
- [ ] Eloquent API Resource and resource collection support
- [ ] Laravel Octane safety, with no validator state leaking between requests
- [ ] Migration notes for projects coming from `werk365/etagconditionals`

## Testing

```bash
composer test          # static analysis, lint, type coverage, and the test suite
composer test:unit     # Pest only
composer analyse       # PHPStan
composer lint          # Pint
```
